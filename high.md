Absolutely—here’s a quick recap of our ESP-NOW/Cardputer discussion:

Hardware & Role
We agreed you’d use the M5Stack Cardputer (ESP32-S3 based) as the master node—leveraging its built-in display and keyboard for a simple CLI—and any generic ESP32 as a slave. Slaves auto-join the mesh as soon as they power up, no manual pairing required.

Networking Protocol
We’d use ESP-NOW for fast, connectionless, peer-to-peer links (up to a few hundred meters), optionally bootstrapping via BLE before falling back to ESP-NOW if you need longer range or simpler setup.

Discovery & Pairing
The master periodically broadcasts a DISCOVERY_REQUEST. Any slave hearing that replies with a DISCOVERY_RESPONSE, at which point the master adds its MAC to a “connected slaves” list.

Message Types
We defined an enum like:

enum MsgType : uint8_t {
  MSG_DISCOVERY_REQUEST,
  MSG_DISCOVERY_RESPONSE,
  MSG_COMMAND,
  MSG_ACK,
  MSG_TEXT_RESPONSE,
  MSG_PREPARE_DEAUTH,
  MSG_FIRE_DEAUTH
};

Then wrapped into a fixed-size struct so everything stays under ESP-NOW’s ~250 byte limit.

Commands & Features

Scan: instruct all slaves to perform a distributed Wi-Fi channel scan and report back.

Deauth: tell slaves which BSSID to deauthenticate and fire off deauth packets in sync.

Custom CLI: typed on the Cardputer’s keyboard, rendered on its TFT via the M5Unified / M5Cardputer library.

Security Trade-Offs
We left slaves unencrypted for simplicity, since this is for closed-campus testing—but noted you could add a shared key to esp_now_set_self_role() and esp_now_add_peer() if you ever wanted basic ESP-NOW encryption.

Code Structure

Master initializes Wi-Fi in WIFI_STA mode, calls esp_now_init(), registers send/receive callbacks, and manages a std::vector<Slave> with MACs and last-seen timestamps.

Slave does the same but auto-responds to discovery and waits for commands
